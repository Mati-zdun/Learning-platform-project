          <br />

          <p>
            Data types are the kinds of values that you can store and manipulate
            in JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>There are eight basic data types in JavaScript:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Number:</strong> Represents numeric data, including
              integers and floating-point numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>String:</strong> Represents textual data enclosed within
              single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Boolean:</strong> Represents logical values: true or
              false.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Undefined:</strong> Represents a variable that has been
              declared but not assigned a value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Null:</strong> Represents the intentional absence of any
              object value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Symbol:</strong> Represents unique identifiers. Introduced
              in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Object:</strong> Represents a collection of key-value
              pairs where values can be of any data type.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>BigInt:</strong> Represents integers of arbitrary length.
              Introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A data type in programming is a classification that specifies what
            type of value a variable can hold, what operations can be performed
            on the variable, and how the variable is stored in memory. It
            defines the characteristics of data stored in variables or used in
            expressions, such as numbers, text, or logical values.

          <h2>Module 2: Basic Syntax</h2>

          <p>
            The syntax used in JavaScript is the set of rules describing how the
            program is structured, with JavaScript having a similar syntax to
            Java and C.
          </p>

          <p>Numbers (can be written both with and without decimals):</p>
          <pre>
          10
          10.05
          </pre>

          <p>
            Strings (are written with single or double quotations ('' or "")):
          </p>
          <pre>
          “Hello”
          ‘Goodbye’
          </pre>

          <p>
            Variables (use var, let and const with an equal's sign to declare
            variables):
          </p>
          <pre>
          let y;
          y = 4;
          </pre>

          <p>Operations (use arithmetic to compute values):</p>
          <pre>
          +
          -
          *
          /
          </pre>

          <p>
            Operations (also use the equals sign to assign values to variables):
          </p>
          <pre>
          =
          </pre>

          <p>
            Comments (are made by having a double slash (//) at the start of the
            comment you want to make):
          </p>
          <pre>
          Let y = 5; // y equals 5
          </pre>

          <p>
            Expressions (use values, variables and operations to get a value):
          </p>
          <pre>
          2 * 4 // answer = 8
          4 + 10 // answer = 14
          “Sam” + “_” + “Green” // answer = Sam_Green
          </pre>

          <p>
            In this lesson, we'll cover the basic syntax of JavaScript.
            Understanding the syntax is crucial as it forms the foundation of
            writing JavaScript code.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript syntax includes rules for writing statements,
            declarations, expressions, and comments. We'll explore each of these
            elements in detail.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript involves creating
              objects with both data and functionality, promoting modular and
              reusable code.
            </li>
            <li>
              It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to
              organize code and facilitate reuse.
            </li>
            <li>
              Functional Programming Paradigm treats computation as the
              evaluation of mathematical functions, focusing on pure functions
              and immutable data.
            </li>
            <li>
              It encourages declarative code, avoiding mutable state and side
              effects for simpler programs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await) enables
              non-blocking I/O, allowing concurrent tasks without waiting for
              each to complete.
            </li>
            <li>
              Promises offer a cleaner alternative to callback-based code, while
              async/await provides readable syntax for async operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modules and Module Loaders organize code into reusable units,
              enhancing scalability and organization.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encapsulating related code prevents naming conflicts and promotes
              modularity, simplifying dependency management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Browser APIs and DOM Manipulation let developers interact with the
              DOM and access browser features.
            </li>
            <li>
              They offer methods for dynamic web page manipulation, event
              handling, HTTP requests, and browser-specific functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Error Handling and Debugging Techniques involve identifying,
              handling, and resolving errors and bugs in code.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using try-catch blocks, logging errors, and browser developer
              tools help in debugging and ensuring code reliability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Understanding and applying these principles are crucial for
              developing efficient, scalable JavaScript applications.

          <h1>Variables: JavaScript Lesson 3</h1>

          <br /><br />
          <h2>Module 3: Variables</h2>

          <p>
            Variables are containers used for storing information, with
            variables being known as “Declaring”. Variables can contain any type
            of data (e.g., string, objects, true or false boldens and numbers).
          </p>

          <p>There are 3 different types of variables:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>var</li>
            <li>let</li>
            <li>const</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Each of these 3 types of variables has its own rules of how they can
            be used, and each one has its own characteristics.
          </p>

          <p>Examples of <code>var</code> variables:</p>
          <pre>
          var name = “Max”;
          var age = 52;
          var pass = true;
          </pre>

          <p>
            <code>var</code> are used to declare variable. <br />
            <code>name</code> is used to give the variable a name. <br />
            The <code>=</code> is used to tell the program that we are assigning
            a value to the variable. <br />
            The name Max it the value used in the variable. <br />
            <code>var</code> variables can be accessed anywhere in the program,
            but Local variables are declared using <code>let</code> and
            <code>const</code> and can only be used on certain blocks of the
            code.
          </p>

          <p>Examples of <code>let</code> variables:</p>
          <pre>
          let time = “day”;
          
          if (time === “day”) {
              let time = “night”;
              console.log (“It is ${time} outside!”);
          }
          
          console.log (“It is ${time} outside!”);
          </pre>

          <p>
            <code>let</code> are used in the same way a <code>var</code> to
            declare variables. <br />
            The if statement changes the time variable from day to night but
            when the if statement is finished it will return to day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Variables are fundamental in programming as they allow us to store
            and manipulate data. In this lesson, we'll explore variables in
            JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            We'll learn how to declare and initialize variables, understand
            variable naming conventions, and explore different variable scopes.

          <p>
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that
            revolves around the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and
            behavior. In JavaScript, objects are created using either object
            literals or constructor functions. OOP in JavaScript involves
            principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
            Encapsulation refers to bundling data and methods that operate on
            the data within a single unit, i.e., an object. Inheritance allows
            objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects,
            promoting code reuse. Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as
            instances of their parent class, facilitating code flexibility and
            modularity.

          <h2>Module 4: Operations</h2>

          <p>
            Operations are the symbols in between the values that allow for
            different operations to occur.
          </p>

          <p>There are many different types of operations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The plus (<code>+</code>) is used for addition operations.</li>
            <li>
              The hyphen (<code>-</code>) is used for subtraction operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              The asterisk (<code>*</code>) is used for multiplication
              operations.
            </li>
            <li>The slash (<code>/</code>) is used for dividing operations.</li>
            <li>
              The equals sign (<code>=</code>) is used for assigning values to
              variables.
            </li>
            <li>
              The greater-than sign (<code>&gt;</code>) is used for greater than
              operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              The less-than sign (<code>&lt;</code>) is used for less than
              operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also add an equals sign to the greater-than or the
              less-than sign so making it equivalent to or greater/less than
              (<code>&gt;=</code> or <code>&lt;=</code>).
            </li>
            <li>
              An exclamation mark and an equals sign (<code>!=</code>) are used
              to show something that is not equal.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Examples:</p>
          <pre>
          let a = 10;
          let b = 2;
          let c = a + b;
          let d = a - b;
          let e = a * b;
          let f = a / b;
          let g = 10 < 20;
          let h = 10 > 5;
          let i = 5 >= 3;
          let j = 3 <= 5;

          <h2>Module 5: Control Structures</h2>

          <p>
            Control structures are used to control the execution of a program
            based on a specific condition. If the condition is met, then a
            particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will
            execute another block of action that satisfies the condition. Some
            control structures include conditionals (if/else, switch) and loops
            (while, do-while, for, for-in, for-of).
          </p>

          <p>Example 1:</p>

          <pre>
if (condition) {
  // block of code if condition is true
} else {
  // block of code if condition is false
}
</pre
          >

          <p>Example 2:</p>

          <pre>
if (condition1) {
  // block of code if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code if condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code if condition2 is false
}
</pre
          >
          <p>
            Control structures are fundamental components in programming that
            enable you to manage the flow of execution in your JavaScript code.
            They allow you to make decisions, repeat actions, and handle
            different scenarios based on specified conditions.
          </p>
          <h3>Conditional Statements</h3>
          <p>
            Conditional statements, such as <code>if</code>,
            <code>else if</code>, and <code>else</code>, provide the ability to
            execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions. These
            statements allow you to implement decision-making logic, enabling
            your program to adapt and respond to different scenarios.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>if Statement:</strong> The <code>if</code> statement
              evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the
              condition is true.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>else if Statement:</strong> The
              <code>else if</code> statement provides an additional condition to
              test if the initial <code>if</code> condition is false.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>else Statement:</strong> The <code>else</code> statement
              executes a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are
              true.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Loops</h3>
          <p>
            Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a
            specified condition is met. JavaScript offers different types of
            loops, each serving a specific purpose and allowing for various
            iteration scenarios.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>for Loop:</strong> The <code>for</code> loop executes a
              block of code a specified number of times, iterating over a range
              of values defined by an initialization, condition, and iteration
              expression.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>while Loop:</strong> The <code>while</code> loop repeats a
              block of code as long as a specified condition remains true,
              allowing for indefinite iteration based on the condition's
              evaluation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>do...while Loop:</strong> The <code>do...while</code> loop
              is similar to the <code>while</code> loop, but it always executes
              the block of code at least once before checking the loop
              condition.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Switch Statements</h3>
          <p>
            Switch statements provide an alternative to multiple
            <code>if...else</code> statements when you need to compare a single
            value against multiple possible values. They offer a concise and
            efficient way to execute different blocks of code based on the value
            of a variable or expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            By mastering control structures in JavaScript, you gain the ability
            to write more dynamic and responsive code, making your programs more
            flexible and adaptable to various situations.

          <h1>Functions: JavaScript Lesson 6</h1>
          <br />

          <h2>Module 6: Functions</h2>

          <p>
            Functions take an input (this could be calculating a value or
            perform a task) and return an output. This is known as invoking or
            call.
          </p>

          <p>Example 1:</p>

          <pre>
a = My_Function(2, 3); // defining what x and y are  

function My_Function(x, y) { // the function is called. 
    let a = x * y;
    return a; // it will return the 2 numbers multiplied together. 
}

Result: 6
</pre
          >

          <p>
            Function is the key word used to start the function. My_Function is
            the name given to the function. Everything inside the curly brackets
            {} is the body of the function. Return will print out the results of
            the function.
          </p>

          <p>Example 2:</p>

          <pre>
// In this example operator () is invoked. 
function My_Function(x) {
    return (6 / 2) * (x + 5);
}

let value = My_Function(5);

Result: 30
</pre
          >

          <p>
            Functions are essential building blocks in JavaScript that enable
            you to encapsulate and reuse blocks of code. In this lesson, we'll
            explore functions in depth, covering their syntax, parameters,
            return values, and scope.
          </p>
          <h3>Function Declaration</h3>
          <p>
            Function declarations define named functions, specifying the
            function's name, parameters (if any), and the code block to be
            executed when the function is called.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Syntax:</strong>
              <code
                >function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) { // Function
                body }</code
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Function Expressions</h3>
          <p>
            Function expressions involve defining a function as part of an
            expression, typically by assigning it to a variable. They offer
            flexibility and can be anonymous or named.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Anonymous Function Expression:</strong>
              <code
                >var myFunction = function(parameter1, parameter2) { // Function
                body }</code
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Named Function Expression:</strong>
              <code
                >var myFunction = function functionName(parameter1, parameter2)
                { // Function body }</code
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Function Scope</h3>
          <p>
            Function scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of
            variables defined within a function. Understanding function scope is
            crucial for managing variable lifetimes and avoiding unintended side
            effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            By mastering functions in JavaScript, you'll unlock the power of
            code organization, reusability, and abstraction, leading to more
            modular and maintainable applications.

          <h1>Objects: JavaScript Lesson 7</h1>

          <h2>Module 7: Objects</h2>

          <p>
            Objects signal an entity that has properties and types. It is used
            to assign value to an object. For example, a person can be an object
            with properties such as first name, last name, height, eye color and
            so on with values assigned to each property.
          </p>

          <p>Example 1:</p>

          <pre>
const person = {
    FirstName: "Alex",
    LastName: "Wood",
    height: 5.10
};
</pre
          >

          <p>Example 2:</p>

          <pre>
const car = {
    Type_of_Car: "Volkswagen",
    Reg_Numb: "159S 1O9",
    Color: "Green"
};
</pre
          >
          <p>
            Objects are fundamental data structures in JavaScript that enable
            you to store and manipulate complex data. In this lesson, we'll dive
            deep into objects, exploring their properties, methods, prototypes,
            and inheritance.
          </p>
          <h3>Object Creation</h3>
          <p>
            Objects in JavaScript can be created using object literals,
            constructor functions, or the <code>Object()</code> constructor.
            Each method offers different capabilities and use cases for creating
            objects.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Object Literal:</strong>
              <code>var person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Constructor Function:</strong>
              <code
                >function Person(name, age) { this.name = name; this.age = age;
                }</code
              >
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Object Constructor:</strong>
              <code
                >var person = new Object(); person.name = 'John'; person.age =
                30;</code
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Object Methods</h3>
          <p>
            Object methods are functions defined within an object, allowing you
            to perform actions or calculations related to the object's
            properties. They enable encapsulation and provide a way to interact
            with object data.
          </p>
          <h3>Prototypes and Inheritance</h3>
          <p>
            Prototypes and inheritance are advanced concepts in JavaScript that
            allow objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
            Understanding prototypes is essential for leveraging JavaScript's
            powerful object-oriented capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            By mastering objects in JavaScript, you'll gain the ability to model
            real-world entities, organize data effectively, and build scalable
            and maintainable applications.

          <h1>Arrays: JavaScript Lesson 8</h1>
          <br />

          <h2>Module 8: Arrays</h2>

          <p>
            An array is a type of global object that is used to store data. It
            allows users to store and organize multiple values within a single
            variable. The syntax to create an array in JavaScript is:
          </p>
          <pre>
const array_name = [item1, item2,...];
</pre
          >

          <p>Example 1:</p>

          <pre>
const cars = ["Ford", "BMW", "Volvo"];
</pre
          >

          <p>Example 2 (with elements provided):</p>

          <pre>
const cars = [];
cars[0] = "Ford";
cars[1] = "BMW";
cars[2] = "Volvo";
</pre
          >

          <p>Note: Array elements start with [0].</p>

          <p>
            Arrays are versatile data structures in JavaScript that allow you to
            store collections of elements. In this lesson, we'll explore arrays
            comprehensively, covering array creation, manipulation, iteration,
            and common array methods.
          </p>
          <h3>Array Creation</h3>
          <p>
            Arrays can be created using array literals or the
            <code>Array()</code> constructor. They can hold elements of any data
            type and can dynamically resize as elements are added or removed.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Array Literal:</strong>
              <code>var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Array Constructor:</strong>
              <code>var colors = new Array('red', 'green', 'blue');</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Array Manipulation</h3>
          <p>
            Arrays offer various methods for adding, removing, and modifying
            elements. These methods enable you to manipulate array contents
            dynamically based on your application's requirements.
          </p>
          <h3>Array Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            Array iteration involves traversing through each element of an array
            and performing an action on each element. JavaScript provides
            multiple ways to iterate over arrays, including
            <code>for</code> loops, <code>forEach()</code> method, and array
            destructuring.
          </p>
          <p>
            By mastering arrays in JavaScript, you'll have a powerful tool at
            your disposal for storing, organizing, and processing data
            efficiently, empowering you to build dynamic and interactive
            applications.
